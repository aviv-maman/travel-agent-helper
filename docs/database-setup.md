# Database setup

The app uses **[Neon](https://neon.tech) (serverless Postgres)** with **[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team)**. What lives there:

- **Hotels** (`/hotels`) — `destinations`, `hotels`, and related tables, including the hotels' Google Places enrichment columns (rating, review count, address, website, photo URL — migration 0026).
- **Content guides** — `suppliers` (+ `supplier_commissions`, `supplier_cancellations`), `airlines`, `transfer_countries`/`transfer_cities`, and the shared `contacts` phonebook, powering `/suppliers`, `/cancellation-fees`, `/airlines`, `/transfers`.
- **AI assistant data** — `quote_suppliers` (the commission table the AI prices quotes with, edited at Settings → AI Commissions; migration 0025), `saved_quotes`, `user_ai_credentials`.
- **Auth** — `users`, `sessions`, `invitations`, `login_attempts`.
- **Per-user features** — the dashboard tables ([docs/dashboard.md](./dashboard.md)), `exchange_rates`.

Every content page still works with **no database at all**: the curated data arrays in `lib/{commissions,cancellations,airlines,transfers,contacts}.ts` are both the seed source and the no-DB fallback (the same split as hotels ↔ `data/seed.json`). **Code is the source of truth for most content** — edit the array, then `bun run seed`. The exceptions are **app-managed** (edited in the UI by editors, bootstrap-only in the seed, never overwritten by re-seeds):

- **contacts** — the shared phonebook dialog;
- **supplier commission lines & baggage** — the pencil/+ inline editors on the supplier cards;
- **airline suitcase/trolley/commission figures** — the pencil on the airlines table rows;
- **transfer inclusion pills** — the pencil on the transfers page;
- **the AI quote-commissions table** (`quote_suppliers`) — the Settings-page editor (bootstrapped once by `scripts/seed-quote-suppliers.ts`);
- **hotel Google Places enrichment** — filled by `scripts/enrich-hotels-places.ts` (never part of the seed JSON; `scripts/seed.ts` snapshots and re-applies it by hotel name across its wholesale hotel replace; ratings are auto-refreshed weekly by the backend's `/cron/places`).

Editing those in `lib/*.ts` only affects the no-DB fallback and brand-new databases.

> **The error you saw** (`Failed query: select … from "destinations" …` on `/hotels`) means the connection worked but the **tables don't exist yet** — you set `DATABASE_URL` but never applied the migrations. Steps 2–3 below fix it.

Run the commands with **`bun run …`** (not `npm run`): this is a Bun project, and Bun automatically loads `.env.local` into the environment, which the Drizzle commands need.

---

## 1. Set the connection string

1. In the Neon console: **Project → Connection Details → "Pooled connection"** (the host contains `-pooler`). Pooled is the right one for a serverless app.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and paste your string:

   ```bash
   # .env.local
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST-pooler.REGION.aws.neon.tech/DB?sslmode=require"
   ```

   - `?sslmode=require` is mandatory for Neon.
   - `.env.local` is git-ignored — secrets never get committed.
   - Next.js and Bun both load `.env.local` automatically; you never read the file manually.

## 2. Create the tables (apply migrations)

```bash
bun install          # once, if you haven't installed deps
bun run db:migrate   # creates every table from the files in drizzle/
```

This runs each SQL file in `drizzle/` in order (`0000_…` onward — the folder keeps growing as features land), building the whole schema: hotels, content guides, auth, dashboard, and AI tables. After this, `/hotels` stops erroring (it'll just be empty until step 3).

## 3. Load the data (seed)

```bash
bun run seed
```

Runs both seed scripts: `scripts/seed.ts` populates `destinations`, `hotels`, `landmarks`, etc. from `data/seed.json`, and `scripts/seed-content.ts` populates the content tables (suppliers, commissions, cancellations, airlines, transfers, contacts) from the `lib/*.ts` data arrays. Both are **idempotent** — parents are upserted, cancellations/transfer children replaced wholesale. The app-managed data (contacts, supplier commission lines, supplier baggage) is **bootstrap-only**: seeded when missing, never overwritten on re-runs. `bun run seed:content` runs just the content half.

## 4. Create your first admin (auth bootstrap)

Registration is invite-only, so there's a chicken-and-egg problem for the very first user. This script solves it:

```bash
bun run create-admin myname 'a-strong-password'
```

Creates (or promotes) that user as an **admin**. Log in at `/en/login` (or `/he/login`), then everyone else self-registers with invite codes you generate under **Manage invites**.

## 5. Run the app

```bash
bun run dev
```

Visit `/hotels` (data), `/en/login` (sign in), `/en/admin/users`, `/en/admin/invites`.

## How the Drizzle workflow works

The schema is defined **in TypeScript** in [`db/schema.ts`](../db/schema.ts) — that's the source of truth. Three commands turn it into a real database:

| Command | What it does | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bun run db:generate` | Diffs `schema.ts` against the existing migrations and writes a new SQL file to `drizzle/`. **Offline** — no DB needed. | After you change `schema.ts`. |
| `bun run db:migrate` | Runs the pending `drizzle/*.sql` files against the database, recording which ran. | To apply schema changes (incl. first setup). |
| `bun run db:push` | Shortcut that syncs `schema.ts` straight to the DB **without** creating migration files. | Quick local experiments only. |
| `bun run db:studio` | Opens Drizzle Studio, a browser UI to view/edit rows. | To inspect data. |

**This project uses the migrate flow** (generate → commit the SQL → migrate), because the `drizzle/` files are a reviewable, replayable history of the schema — the right choice for anything heading to production. `db:push` is convenient in dev but leaves no history (it's how the `aparthotel` enum value once drifted).

The typical change loop:

```
edit db/schema.ts  →  bun run db:generate  →  review drizzle/000X_*.sql  →  bun run db:migrate
```

## Maintenance

- `bun run cleanup` — deletes expired sessions and stale login-attempt rows. Schedule it (a daily cron) so those tables don't grow forever.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Failed query: select … from "destinations"` | Tables not created | `bun run db:migrate` |
| `/hotels` loads but is empty | Tables exist, no data | `bun run seed` |
| `DATABASE_URL is not set` | `.env.local` missing or command run without Bun | Create `.env.local`; use `bun run …` |
| Connection/timeout error | Wrong string or missing `?sslmode=require` | Re-copy the **Pooled** string from Neon |
| Can't log in / register asks for a code | No admin yet | `bun run create-admin <user> <pass>` |
